# If the numbers 1 to 4 are written out in words: one, twi, three, four, five,
# then there are 3+3+5+4+4 = 19 letters used in total. If all the numbers from 1
# to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters
# would be used?

# write out hash for all numbers

# generate all numbers

# iterate through numbers and check hash

# check one digit numbers

# save sum of all one digit numbers

# check two digit numbers

# save sum of all 2 digit numbers

# check three digit numbers

# add eleven to total for 'one thousand'
